## About the Collection
Due to time constraints, this is only a small sample of the thousands of photos from the Nash-Russell-Welch collection. These 36 photos were not selected for any particular reason. They were scanned, edited, and uploaded randomly. As of today, November 20th, 2023, all the photos on this site are from the Nash Collection. 

Nearly all the photos were taken by Nellie Jean Nash and her daughter, Janice Nash. Nellie is the great-grandmother, and Janice the grandmother, of the aspiring librarian typing this now. They are both dearly missed. This collection is meant to honor their memory and document how much they loved their families. This project was taken on as a reminder that physical objects can only go so far. While still important to be able to examine, a digital collection like this one will be able to be shared with extended family on social media, and serve as a digial ofrenda for loved ones passed. 

This digital library project is an assignment for the class ILS-Z 652 Digital Libraries, taught by John Walsh and Alex Wingate. A special thanks to them for their patience and generous grading throughout the semester. Another thank you goes to the CollectionBuilder team, as it is without their template that this website would not be possible. 

The metadata standards are inspired from the demo collection that CollectionBuilder uses for the GitHub sample. The required fields for this project include objectid, filename, title, format, description, creator, date, date-is-approximate, item_information, subject, locatiton, latitude, longitude, rights statement, type, and language. While these photos are available for public viewing, please respect the families' privacy and do not use them for profit or download. 

## Coming Up 
This was only a small sample of photos. There are several photos that have been digitized that are awaiting editing, and several that have not touched the scanner. To continue, I have not been able to collect photos from either the Russell or Welch side of the family, nor digital born photos. In the future, I hope to gather those and add them to this website. 

## Browsing the Collection 
The home page serves as a home base for you to get a basic overview of the collection. The description on that page is very brief. For a more detailed description, please see above. The dates in that section allow for you to get an idea of the many lives involved in making this collection happen. The earliest photo in the collection is dated December of 1967. The youngest photo is dated June of 2009. Family members range from great grandparents to great grandchildren. Subjects are the names of the family members that are in the pictured at least once, however, this is not an exhaustive list. Locations are the names of the cities in which the photos were taken. 

The navigation bar allows you to switch back and forth between web pages. The browse page allows for the best overall look of the photos and to browse more generally. For more detailed descriptions, and to look at all of the metadata, click "View Full Record". This will allow you to just look at that image. To browse by photos of the people in them, click the subjects button. This will take you to the photos with those specific people picture. There are several combinations. This is very similar to the locations button, which separates the photos based on where they were taken. There will be more locations as more photos are added. Similarly, the map lets you see where they were taken on a geographical level, as well as how many photos were taken in each city. 

The family tree button will take you out to a custom family tree made possible by Family Echo. This only has first and last names, but allows you to see, visually, how everyone is related. This will continue to be updated as more photos are uploaded and more family members are added. 

The data page allows you to view the photos in the collection as objects. Wih this, you are able to see how much information I was able to pull from the photos.
